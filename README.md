## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Gemini API key

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arittra-Bag/SalesDuo.git
cd SalesDuo
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment setup**
   - Create a `.env` file with your Gemini API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     PORT=3000
     ```
   - Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

4. **Start the server**
```bash
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Development Mode

For development with auto-restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing the API

### Option 1: Use the Web Interface (Bonus Feature)
Open `http://localhost:3000` for a minimal frontend demo interface

### Option 2: Test with cURL

**Raw Text (Linux/Mac):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/process-meeting \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Team Sync â€“ May 26\n\n- We will launch the new product on June 10.\n- Ravi to prepare onboarding docs by June 5.\n- Priya will follow up with logistics team on packaging delay.\n- Beta users requested a mobile-first dashboard."
  }'
```

**Raw Text (Windows CMD):**
```cmd
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/process-meeting -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"text\": \"Team Sync - May 26\\n\\n- We will launch the new product on June 10.\\n- Ravi to prepare onboarding docs by June 5.\\n- Priya will follow up with logistics team on packaging delay.\\n- Beta users requested a mobile-first dashboard.\"}"
```

**File Upload:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/process-meeting -F "file=@samples/meeting1.txt"
```

### Option 3: Test with Postman
1. **Method**: POST
2. **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/process-meeting`
3. **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
4. **Body** (raw JSON):
```json
{
  "text": "Team Sync â€“ May 26\n\n- We'll launch the new product on June 10.\n- Ravi to prepare onboarding docs by June 5.\n- Priya will follow up with logistics team on packaging delay.\n- Beta users requested a mobile-first dashboard."
}
```

**For File Upload in Postman:**
- **Body**: form-data
- **Key**: `file`
- **Type**: File
- **Value**: Select `samples/meeting1.txt` or `samples/meeting2.txt`

## Sample Output

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "summary": "The team decided to launch the new product on June 10. Ravi was assigned to prepare onboarding documentation, and Priya will follow up with the logistics team regarding a packaging delay. Feedback from beta users highlighted a request for a mobile-first dashboard.",
    "decisions": [
      "The new product will launch on June 10."
    ],
    "actionItems": [
      {
        "task": "Prepare onboarding docs",
        "owner": "Ravi",
        "due": "June 5"
      },
      {
        "task": "Follow up with logistics team on packaging delay",
        "owner": "Priya",
        "due": null
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "processedAt": "2025-09-17T22:26:52.871Z",
